How to get abiword to link against wv rather than libmswordview

===ASKED===
awml name="doc name", this might be useful to put in the title bar
and gives a location to hold the msword title :-)

does justify actually justify ?? (it appears it should)

whats the story on text indentation, can we do the first line seperate from
the rest.
