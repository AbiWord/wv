The xml tags for the configuration file that wvHtml and friends can read in
are reasonably complex. Here I attempt to document what they are and what
they mean.

TABLES
======

Each table is comprised of a number of rows each of which has a number
of cells, cells may be merged vertically with ones below them, and 
horzontially with ones to the right. If a cell is merged with cells to
the right or below, then the other cells that it is merged with will
not trigger a cell event of their own. This is sufficient for html, and
hopefully for other conversions.

In word tables are basically a set of unrelated rows one under the other,
in wv these rows are magically combined together and all the figures 
worked out so as to merge these rows into a single table which stands
alone as an entity of its own that knows its number of cols and rows, and
how they match up under eachother.

table is defined as so...
<table>
<begin>TAGS</begin>
<end>TAGS</end>
</table>
begin is output at the begin table event and
end is output at the end table event.

There are a number of tags which only exist with table, there are
<tablerelwidth/>, 	this is the percentage width of the table in
terms of the total page width.
<no_cols/>, this is the maximum number of columns that are in this
table.
<no_rows/>, this is the maximum number of rows that are in this
table.

Html example is
<table>
<begin>&lt;table width=&quot;<tablerelwidth/>&quot; border=&quot;1&quot; 
cols=&quot;<no_cols/>&quot; rows=&quot;<no_rows/>&quot;&gt;</begin>
<end>&lt;/table&gt;</end>
</table>


Rows
----
Each row is defined as so...
<row>
<begin>TAGS</begin>
<end>TAGS</end>
</row>

No tags exist inside a row as yet.

Html example is

<row>
<begin>&lt;tr&gt;</begin>
<end>&lt;/tr&gt;</end>
</row>

Cells
-----
Cells are defined as
<cell>
<begin>TAGS</begin>
<end>TAGS</end>
</cell>

Tags that may exist inside a cell are
<rowspan/>, this is the number of rows that this cell spans
<colspan/>, this is the number of columns that this cell spans,
<cellrelwidth/>, this is the percentage width of the cell in
terms on the total table width, handy for html
<cellrelpagewidth/>, this is the percentage width of the cell in
terms on the total page width, handy for latex
<cellbgcolor/>, this will print the color of the background of the cell
(word can color each cell seperately), the color will be as speced
in the color tags mentioned later

Html example is

<cell>
<begin>&lt;td bgcolor=&quot;<cellbgcolor/>&quot; width=&quot;<cellrelwidth/>&quot;
rowspan=&quot;<rowspan/>&quot; colspan=&quot;<colspan/>&quot;&gt;</begin>
<end>&lt;/td&gt;</end>
</cell>

There exists another tag called lastcell which can be used to handle the last 
cell in each row seperately, lastcell is speced exactly the same as cell,

i.e.
<lastcell>
<begin>TAGS</begin>
<end>TAGS</end>
</lastcell>


USING TABLE TAGS
----------------

Once you have speced out the table, row, cell and optionally the lastcell you
have to place them inside a paragraph tag, this will be explained later on
in this document, but for the moment take a look at this example of putting
it all together.

<paragraph>
<begin>
<table.end/>
<table.begin/>
<row.begin/>
<cell.begin/>
</begin>
<end>
<entry.end/>
<cell.end/>
<row.end/>
</end>
</paragraph>

This all makes sense in that each end tag is before its containers end tag
so all will work out ok from a html output point of view. There is one
very odd thing here as you can see, the table.end is before the table.begin
this is because as mentioned at the beginning of this section tables in
word are not really tables. There is not a marker in word to show that a
table has ended, so you do not know until the beginning of the next 
paragrah after the table that the table has infact ended. So currently you
test for the end of the previous table in the paragraph directly after it,
the library may provide a workaround for this in the future to allow more 
intuitive behaviour. wv guarantee that an empty dummy paragraph will be
output if necessary to close off all these tags that rely on the following
paragraph to fulfill their dependancies.
