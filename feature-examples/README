this isnt finished yet, this will be a clearing house
of all the word features that mswordview can convert 
and handle.

fully done are...

supported-font-features.doc
supported-paragraph-features.doc
supported-hyperlink-features.doc
supported-break-features.doc
supported-caption-features.doc
supported-footnote-1-features.doc
supported-footnote-2-features.doc
supported-footnote-3-features.doc
supported-footnote-4-features.doc

not fully done are...

1) some missing field support makes supported-headers-features.doc incomplete
and theres one bug in the header above Chapter1 I am a H1 title
2) supported-footnote-5-features.doc is fine, except that the cross and double
cross symbols arent iso chars, and as such are wrong.
3) supported-revision-features.doc is not finished yet
