This file is out of date, last modified October 2000. Even I (fjf) am not listed
here... :-) I've tried to acknowledge people in the release notes, as far as I
could figure out who'd done what, which isn't easy since CHANGELOG gave up after
0.6.0.

Anyway, just to say that your absence from this list is not a snub, merely a
blanket laziness on the part of the developers.
