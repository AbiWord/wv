<font size="3" face="Times New Roman,Times"><b><u>New Technology</u></b></font>
</p>

<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman,Times">Previous versions
of Word 8 password recovery products use password guessing
attacks based on dictionary words or brute force guessing. Well
chosen, long passwords, non dictionary words,&nbsp; or passwords
using special characters (@(*&amp;%$#!?/\) could take centuries
to guess using a single Pentium computer. There are just too many
combinations of characters.</font> </p>

<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman,Times">Crak Software has
developed a new software and hardware solution to recover Excel
and Word version 8 files. We can now guarantee file recovery
regardless of password length and complexity within 30 days (15
days on the average) for well motivated customers.</font><font
face="Times New Roman,Times"> Crak Software can do this because
we search for encryption keys...not passwords.</font> </p>

<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman,Times">There are many
more possible Excel and Word version 8 passwords than keys. ITAR
(Federal encryption regulations) necessitated this design.&nbsp;
Encryption software for export was restricted to 40 bits until
just recently. Nobody knows what the new restrictions are because
nobody can understand the new EAR which replaced the old ITAR
(except possibly Al Gore and he's busy &quot;inventing&quot; the
Internet...what a bozo...).</font> </p>

<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman,Times">Our system DOES
NOT guess passwords. We use a specially designed processing array
to systematically search the entire encryption key space.&nbsp;
The key space is much smaller than the password space.&nbsp; We
could not get through the door, so we went through the Windows
(so to speak...that's a pun).</font> </p>

<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman,Times"><b><u>How Word 8
Encrypts a Document</u></b></font> </p>

<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman,Times">Excel and Word 8
encrypt (scramble) the documents by taking a password, converting
it to Unicode (a type of character using two bytes to encode each
printable character) and hashing it with a modified MD5 Hash to
produce an encryption key for an RC4 encryption engine.</font> </p>

<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman,Times">The MD5 hash is a
standard &quot;mixing algorithm&quot;. You put a field of text
into the hasher and a 128 bit&nbsp; unique signature of the input
text comes out. Theory suggests that no two reasonably sized
input texts would ever hash to the same 128 bit value.</font><font
face="Times New Roman,Times"> </font><font size="3"
face="Times New Roman,Times">One could hash the Bible, for
instance, to a 128 bit signature. Change just ONE letter anywhere
in the Bible and the resulting hash will be a totally different
number (too bad God didn't specify the MD5 hash value for the
Bible in the first place...it would have made for a lot fewer
religions).</font> </p>

<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman,Times">In Excel and Word
version 8, the password hash is combined with 128 bits of
randomized data (sort of a salty hash). This data is again hashed
with a modified MD5 hash several times (as if once was not
enough) to produce a 128 bit key for the RC4 encryption engine.
When version 8 saves an encrypted file, it also encrypts and
saves a 128 bit nonce and the hash of the nonce. This procedure
allows password verification before decrypting a document.You
definitely do not want to decrypt a document with the wrong
password. To do so would cause&nbsp; Bill Gates' wonderful crash
resistant Windows operating system to
promptly...well...er..CRASH!!</font> </p>

<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman,Times">RC4 is a really
cute encryption algorithm invented by a guy named Ron. Thanks
Ron. For a long time, this engine was the only encryption engine
allowed for export (at the 40 bit level) without special
dispensation from the Encryption Pope. Nobody knew how to get
this dispensation (not even Bill Gates) so the exportable
encryption was limited to 40 bits for a long time...hence MS Word
8 uses 40 bit RC4 encryption. RC4 40 bit encryption was always
crackable by the geeks at NSA (that's why they allowed it to be
exported).</font> </p>

<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman,Times">Now the observant
reader will notice that the version 8 RC4 engine uses a 128 bit
key and only 40 bits of key are allowed. Ok, you are on you way
to figuring out how we crack a version 8 document.</font> </p>

<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman,Times">RC4 40 bit
encryption is crackable by the geeks at CRAK Software because we
just could not stop looking at the problem, no matter how
bloodshot our geeky little eyes got!! It also helped that digital
hardware became so powerful and cheap that a group of digital
geeks over at the Electronic Freedom Foundation were able to
build a processing array with enough juice to break 56 bit DES in
a few hours. Then they wrote a book about it. Thanks digital
geeks!!</font> </p>

<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman,Times"><b><u>How We Do It</u></b></font>
</p>

<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman,Times">We have developed
software and hardware that really screams while searching the key
space. We bat bits around like nobody's business. It is as simple
as that. Oh yeah, we also did some cool detective work to figure
out how the whole process was put together. We followed a lot of
bits around for a long time. NOTHING ON THE PC IS SECURE!!!!!
Remember that Intel.</font><font face="Times New Roman,Times">
Remember that all you encryption theorists out there. No software
is secure. You can purge key, pre-key, keystream and any other
data from memory to your heart's content.&nbsp; Any geek worth
his salt can write tools to defeat your little games. Thanks Bill
Gates.</font> </p>

<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman,Times">Because we search
the entire key space (every single possible key!!!!) we can
absolutely guarantee recovery of your Excel and Word 8 document.</font>
