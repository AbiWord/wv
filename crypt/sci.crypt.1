Not true if you have special hardware to do the brute force crack AND you approach
the problem properly.

Take Word 8 and Excel 8 for instance.  There are many many more passwords than
there are keys.  The RC4 encryption and MD5 (modified) hash used here result in a
key space of 40 bits but a password space that is zillions of times larger.  True,
some of the passwords are duplicates, but not enough so that  a brute force
password search is not ridiculous.

A key search, on the other hand, is a very reasonable proposition given the proper
hardware. At CRAK Software we can search the entire Word 8 and Excel 8  keyspace
at a rate of a few million keys per second.  This gives an exhaustive search for
all possible keys in a few days.  Adios 40 bit RC4 encryption!
