.I wvHtml converts word 6, 7 (95) and 8 (97/2000) documents
into html.
.SS OPTIONS
.TP
.I "\-c charset, \-\-charset charset"
word 97 documents are stored in one of two formats, either in 8 bit
cp1252 or in 16bit unicode. The 8 bit can be converted easily into
western european iso-5589-15, while the unicode can be converted
easily into utf-8. These are the defaults. It in possible to
convert into other formats, it is not recomended as you don't
get a guarantee that the output will be correct, for instance if
you convert an english document into koi8-r encoding then it will
be wrong, but if you are sure then you can override the default
output format using this option. The charsets that are available
for output are
utf-8
iso-5589-15
koi-8
tis-620
.TP
.I "\-c password, \-\-password password"
Due to heroic work done by a great team or workers, the wv library can decrypt password protected
word 97 and older versions of word documents given the correct password.
.TP
.I "\-c config.xml, \-\-config config.xml"
Use this to give the location of the config file, if not used the config file is searched for
by first checking the current directory, and then by looking in the install location, by
default its /usr/local/lib/wv/wvHtml.xml
