wv
==========
It should all work hunky dory from a ./configure followed by 
make and make install, a few sample word files to try this out 
are included in the examples dir. Recommended libraries to also
install to convert wmf files are the zlib library and libwmf 
library. Reccomended libraries for bitmap graphic conversion are
ImageMagick in conjunction with libpng, read on for details and 
download locations.
(redhat users note that..)
If your using Red Hat Version 6 you should have the "zlib", "freetype" 
"ImageMagick" and "png" packages installed. Check with rpm and the 
cd-rom with /Redhat/RPMS/ on it. You will than just need to get, 
compile and install libwmf.


Configure Options
=================
zlib
----
libwv now requires zlib to be able to uncompress wmf files,

(Use ./configure --with-zlib=dir_above_zlibs_include&lib_dirs
if configure does not find zlib on its own)

If configure does not find zlib then libwv will still make, but it'll
warn you about this feature loss. zlib can be found at 
http://www.cdrom.com/pub/infozip/zlib

libwmf
------
libwv also needs libwmf to be able to convert wmf files
to gif files for inclusion in the html output.

(Use ./configure --with-wmf==dir_above_libwmf_include&lib_dirs
if configure does not find libwmf on its own)

If configure does not find libwmf then libwv will still make, but it'll
warn you that it can't convert those wmf's. libwmf can be found at 
http://www.csn.ul.ie/~caolan/docs/libwmf.html

freetype
--------
libwv also needs freetype to be able to allow libwmf to
output text in its conversion of wmf files to gif.

(Use ./configure --with-ttf=dir_above_ttf_includes&lib_dirs
if configure does not find freetype on its own)

It can be found at http://www.freetype.org, *note* libwmf also has to be 
compiled with freetype support for this to work.

ImageMagick
-----------
libwv also needs ImageMagick to be able to convert bmp files
to png, as well as other format conversions

(Use ./configure --with-Magick=dir_above_Magick_includes&lib_dirs
if configure does not find Magick on its own)

It can be found at http://www.wizards.dupont.com/cristy/ImageMagick.html
*note* ImageMagick as to be compiled with png support for this to be of
any use.

General
-------
In each case the dir argument to configure can either be the dir 
*above* the include and lib dirs where the component can be found. 
Or the actual dir where *both* the lib and include files exist.

But in general if you install zlib,libwmf,freetype, png and ImageMagick, then 
you just have
to do
./configure
make

Compilation Problems
====================

(1) Make does nothing except complain
If for some reason the standard make didnt work i.e.
if make gives up without compiling a single thing then try 
gmake -f Makefile 
instead, this is a for systems with old make, like Irix for example.

(2) Cant install libwv from a make install
If install fails due to some systems not allowing installs into user dirs
change the INSTALL variable in the Makefiles to the path of the included
install-sh, this is the kind of thing that happens on AIX.

(3) Final link fails with "undefined reference to `uncompress'"
Now there is one possible problem that i've come across, for some reason
on my old redhat4.2 system there was a libz.a in /usr/X11R6/lib that
libwv was linking against rather than the correct one in /usr/lib.
To fix that i just deleted it :-). You can recognize this problem if the
make breaks like this at link time
gcc -lm -o libwv libwv.o laolareplace.old.o support.o list.o 
	piecetable.o stylesheet.o sprm.o blip.o utf.o init_chp.o field.o 
	formatting.o references.o gpprl.o papchpsep.o hyperlink.o decompresswmf.o 
	table.o annotations.o dop.o roman.o  oledecod/oledecod.o -lz   
	-L/usr/X11R6/lib  -lX11  -lgdwmf -lwmf -lxgd -ldib -lXpm -lttf 
decompresswmf.o: In function `decompress':
decompresswmf.o(.text+0x211): undefined reference to `uncompress'
gmake: *** [libwv] Error 1

The solution is to either delete /usr/X11R6/lib/libz.a or place -L/usr/lib
or -L/usr/local/lib (whichever one has libz.a in it) before -lz i.e
gcc -lm -o libwv libwv.o laolareplace.old.o support.o list.o 
    piecetable.o stylesheet.o sprm.o blip.o utf.o init_chp.o field.o 
	formatting.o references.o gpprl.o papchpsep.o hyperlink.o decompresswmf.o 
	table.o annotations.o dop.o roman.o  oledecod/oledecod.o -L/usr/lib -lz
	-L/usr/X11R6/lib  -lX11  -lgdwmf -lwmf -lxgd -ldib -lXpm -lttf

The current configure script is tweaked to attempt to work around this one
case of distribution madness, which im told is due to usage of the imake 
system and gnuplot or something.

(4) Compilation failed on parser.lex or lex.yy.c
In this case the problem is probably something ive done wrong in the lex 
code, im not a great lex head. The only solution for this one that i
know of is to install flex 2.5.4 or higher, available from ftp.gnu.org.

Alternatively a good lex person could take a look at my definition of
myalpha in parser.lex and see if its a portable definition or not.

Supported Platforms
===================
Ive gotten this to work myself so far on Linux/AIX/Solaris/OSF1 and Windows
(for windows skip to windows section) and ive heard that irix/hpux/bsd also 
work, and i had one report that with some magic it works on os/2. One mad
person ported it to AmigaOS, check the homepage for a link to that insanity.
And there was a few mails from someone who said he had it working under VMS,
i don't have any patches for that one yet though.

libwv for Windows
======================

Its trivial to compile libwv with the cygwin32 package, available from 
www.cygnus.com.  get that package and install it, then unpack libwv and 
run ./configure.  then just add -DWINDOWS to the compiler flags are you are off. 
i.e. change
CC = gcc
to
CC = gcc -DWINDOWS
The only thing that extra define does is change the / to \, in the scanning of a 
command line so as to find the name of the word doc without the prepended path.

I haven't tried libwv under windows since zlib or the wmblib library were
needed to be installed for full functionality, but i imagine that compiling them
under cygwin32 would go smoothly as well, let me know on that one.

Running wvHtml from Netscape
================================
theres some scripts in helper-scripts that were sent to me to
get netscape to use libwv as a helper application. I dont
know anything about them, and they might not work, especially
as the program changes while they dont, but they are a useful
resource, i believe the nsopen nswordview are you're best bet
for this.

Support Files
=============
libwv currently uses gifs to replace the wingding fonts 
and a set of custom graphics for pattern backgrounds for tables, and some
graphics for end of a page, footnotes etc, so do the make install to put
them in the place that libwv will reference them, or use the commandline
options to set their location.

libwv Crashes
==================
I don't believe you. You question the worthiness of my Code? I should kill
you where you stand!, but seriously, follow these steps to help me.

make clean first
add -g -DDEBUG to the flags to the c compiler to generate
a stack of debugging info if things go wrong for you.

if you get a crash please recompile libwv with 
CC options -g -DDEBUG, run and send the output to a temporary
file, and generate a core dump
for tcsh 
limit core unlimited
and run again
then do
gdb libwv core
and type
backtrace
send the output of gdb to me with the bugreport and the output
from the -DDEBUG libwv and if possible send me the file that 
libwv crashed on as well. if the word file is particulary 
big compress it for me please. please mention your platform and
libwv version.

Basic Installation
==================

   These are generic installation instructions.

   The `configure' shell script attempts to guess correct values for
various system-dependent variables used during compilation.  It uses
those values to create a `Makefile' in each directory of the package.
It may also create one or more `.h' files containing system-dependent
definitions.  Finally, it creates a shell script `config.status' that
you can run in the future to recreate the current configuration, a file
`config.cache' that saves the results of its tests to speed up
reconfiguring, and a file `config.log' containing compiler output
(useful mainly for debugging `configure').

   If you need to do unusual things to compile the package, please try
to figure out how `configure' could check whether to do them, and mail
diffs or instructions to the address given in the `README' so they can
be considered for the next release.  If at some point `config.cache'
contains results you don't want to keep, you may remove or edit it.

   The file `configure.in' is used to create `configure' by a program
called `autoconf'.  You only need `configure.in' if you want to change
it or regenerate `configure' using a newer version of `autoconf'.

The simplest way to compile this package is:

  1. `cd' to the directory containing the package's source code and type
     `./configure' to configure the package for your system.  If you're
     using `csh' on an old version of System V, you might need to type
     `sh ./configure' instead to prevent `csh' from trying to execute
     `configure' itself.

     Running `configure' takes awhile.  While running, it prints some
     messages telling which features it is checking for.

  2. Type `make' to compile the package.

  3. Optionally, type `make check' to run any self-tests that come with
     the package.

  4. Type `make install' to install the programs and any data files and
     documentation.

  5. You can remove the program binaries and object files from the
     source code directory by typing `make clean'.  To also remove the
     files that `configure' created (so you can compile the package for
     a different kind of computer), type `make distclean'.  There is
     also a `make maintainer-clean' target, but that is intended mainly
     for the package's developers.  If you use it, you may have to get
     all sorts of other programs in order to regenerate files that came
     with the distribution.

Compilers and Options
=====================

   Some systems require unusual options for compilation or linking that
the `configure' script does not know about.  You can give `configure'
initial values for variables by setting them in the environment.  Using
a Bourne-compatible shell, you can do that on the command line like
this:
     CC=c89 CFLAGS=-O2 LIBS=-lposix ./configure

Or on systems that have the `env' program, you can do it like this:
     env CPPFLAGS=-I/usr/local/include LDFLAGS=-s ./configure

Compiling For Multiple Architectures
====================================

   You can compile the package for more than one kind of computer at the
same time, by placing the object files for each architecture in their
own directory.  To do this, you must use a version of `make' that
supports the `VPATH' variable, such as GNU `make'.  `cd' to the
directory where you want the object files and executables to go and run
the `configure' script.  `configure' automatically checks for the
source code in the directory that `configure' is in and in `..'.

   If you have to use a `make' that does not supports the `VPATH'
variable, you have to compile the package for one architecture at a time
in the source code directory.  After you have installed the package for
one architecture, use `make distclean' before reconfiguring for another
architecture.

Installation Names
==================

   By default, `make install' will install the package's files in
`/usr/local/bin', `/usr/local/man', etc.  You can specify an
installation prefix other than `/usr/local' by giving `configure' the
option `--prefix=PATH'.

   You can specify separate installation prefixes for
architecture-specific files and architecture-independent files.  If you
give `configure' the option `--exec-prefix=PATH', the package will use
PATH as the prefix for installing programs and libraries.
Documentation and other data files will still use the regular prefix.

   In addition, if you use an unusual directory layout you can give
options like `--bindir=PATH' to specify different values for particular
kinds of files.  Run `configure --help' for a list of the directories
you can set and what kinds of files go in them.

   If the package supports it, you can cause programs to be installed
with an extra prefix or suffix on their names by giving `configure' the
option `--program-prefix=PREFIX' or `--program-suffix=SUFFIX'.

Optional Features
=================

   Some packages pay attention to `--enable-FEATURE' options to
`configure', where FEATURE indicates an optional part of the package.
They may also pay attention to `--with-PACKAGE' options, where PACKAGE
is something like `gnu-as' or `x' (for the X Window System).  The
`README' should mention any `--enable-' and `--with-' options that the
package recognizes.

   For packages that use the X Window System, `configure' can usually
find the X include and library files automatically, but if it doesn't,
you can use the `configure' options `--x-includes=DIR' and
`--x-libraries=DIR' to specify their locations.

Specifying the System Type
==========================

   There may be some features `configure' can not figure out
automatically, but needs to determine by the type of host the package
will run on.  Usually `configure' can figure that out, but if it prints
a message saying it can not guess the host type, give it the
`--host=TYPE' option.  TYPE can either be a short name for the system
type, such as `sun4', or a canonical name with three fields:
     CPU-COMPANY-SYSTEM

See the file `config.sub' for the possible values of each field.  If
`config.sub' isn't included in this package, then this package doesn't
need to know the host type.

   If you are building compiler tools for cross-compiling, you can also
use the `--target=TYPE' option to select the type of system they will
produce code for and the `--build=TYPE' option to select the type of
system on which you are compiling the package.

Sharing Defaults
================

   If you want to set default values for `configure' scripts to share,
you can create a site shell script called `config.site' that gives
default values for variables like `CC', `cache_file', and `prefix'.
`configure' looks for `PREFIX/share/config.site' if it exists, then
`PREFIX/etc/config.site' if it exists.  Or, you can set the
`CONFIG_SITE' environment variable to the location of the site script.
A warning: not all `configure' scripts look for a site script.

Operation Controls
==================

   `configure' recognizes the following options to control how it
operates.

`--cache-file=FILE'
     Use and save the results of the tests in FILE instead of
     `./config.cache'.  Set FILE to `/dev/null' to disable caching, for
     debugging `configure'.

`--help'
     Print a summary of the options to `configure', and exit.

`--quiet'
`--silent'
`-q'
     Do not print messages saying which checks are being made.  To
     suppress all normal output, redirect it to `/dev/null' (any error
     messages will still be shown).

`--srcdir=DIR'
     Look for the package's source code in directory DIR.  Usually
     `configure' can determine that directory automatically.

`--version'
     Print the version of Autoconf used to generate the `configure'
     script, and exit.

`configure' also accepts some other, not widely useful, options.
