1) Paragraphs that start with a dropped cap letter i.e. something
that looks sort of like this...

---his is a paragraph
 | with a big T at 
 | the beginning

are stored in word as two seperate paragraphs, one with just a T
and then the rest of it, so in the html conversion you get two
seperate paragraphs with quite a bit of whitespace between them.
I haven't found a way to recognize this occuring or a way to fix
it, but it is pretty uncommon.

2) .... to be filled in ....
