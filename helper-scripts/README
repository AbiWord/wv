these are all scripts sent to me to make mswordview a suitable
helper application for netscape or mail programs. i havent looked or used
them myself, im too tied up in the converter itself for now.

1) WordToTxt converts word to txt via html and lynx.


2) msdoc2html can be used as a helper application for netscape
to view doc files.

Hi,

    I like this mswordview utility. It has been very useful to me.
I wanted to use it to link it in my browser like a plugin. I have
managed to do it with a simple script. I am herewith attaching the
script and also the steps I followed to get it
to work. If you find it useful add to the mswordview package.

Steps :
1. Copy the shell script msdoc2html to /usr/sbin
2. Invoke Netscape and goto Edit->Preferences->Navigator->Applications.
3. Scroll down and select Microsoft Word Document and click on edit
4. Select Application and in the text field add the following :
/usr/sbin/msdoc2html %s

    Once the above is done, anytime you click on either a .doc link or a
word8 doc attachment, you will see the HTML output on your browser.

3) the msword2latex tools, can do a sort of conversion of doc files to
latex, read the msword2latex.sh and msword2latex.pl files for details.
