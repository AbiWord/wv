Read INSTALL for install information.

After installing mswordview the basic things
to note are that 

1) if you compiled with libwmf support mswordview will
by default look for ttf file to give to it in
the ttf subdir of the mswordview install dir
e.g. /usr/local/lib/mswordview/lib

you can copy your windows fonts in there, or make
it a link to where you have some ttf fonts.

2) mswordview uses gifs for some things that it
cannot display in html, the dirs for all of
these can be overridded in command line options
read the man page for these options notable
patternurl, wingdingurl, symbolurl.

3) there is a ridiculous amount of options for mswordview, sorry
about that.

4) There is a config file now as well, its in development so
there not a lot you can override with it. Nonetheless you
can override word stylenames with custom beginnings,endings,
custom handling of the vertical space before and after a
paragraph, and the capacity to allow or disallow the 
bold, italic and font attributes of a style.

so for instance if a word style called "Heading 1" is a
set of text in font Helvetica and is bold and italic, with half
an inch of space before and after it, but you just want it
to be <h1></h1> in the output html. Then you're config file 
can contain

Style "Heading 1"
	{
	PreSpace " "
	Start <h1>
	Default Off
	End </h1>
	PostSpace " "
	}

to achieve this. Read the sample config-mswordview file for
the current set of available options.

5) There are helper applications in the helper-scripts dir
that allow both lynx and netscape to view word 8 docs easily

6) The gateway dir contains the cgi script that allows the
online demo page that some people wanted for themselves.
