BIG kudos to
* Fauzan Mirza <fauzan@dcs.rhbnc.ac.uk> was incredibly helpful in making sense
of what we've got here, and completely rewrote what I originally had
* johnk@crak.com has a website at http://www.crak.com with some information
which allowed me to see what the steps should be.
* Dmitry Sumin <sumin@lostpassword.com> who told me that the page number of
each chunk was fed into the setup of the rc4 prepare_key function

HUGE kudos to 
* (Vesselin Bontchev) <bontchev@complex.is> provided the initial base which
was written (by an obviously god like being) by Peter Ferrie, who both work
at F-Prot the virus people.
* Dieter Spaar <spaar@mirider.augusta.de>, who provided the missing link which
extented the decryption of the first 512 bytes to the entire document
