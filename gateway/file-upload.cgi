#  Version:  Time Stamp:        History:
#  ____________________________________________________________________
#
#     1.00  04/08/96 00:00     The script was created.
#     1.10  04/23/96 00:00     Added User and Group ID to allow file
#                              changing by the actual user, also updated
#                              a security hole which allowed any user with
#                              the UID of 1376 to own the uploaded files.
#                              Also Updated the INSTALL program and README
#                              files.
#     3.00  05/07/96 00:00     New release with group and user id fixes, it
#                              updates a previously unreleased version (2.0)
#     3.10  05/10/96 00:00     Stupid Typo in script fixed, it was
#                              causing problems for some users.
#     4.00  08/04/96 23:16     Security hole regarding '../' paths
#                              fixed.  Thanks to: Rus Berrett.  Mime
#                              type error fixed.  Thanks to: Bob Stewart.
#     4.01  08/07/96 11:20     Typo fixed in &NoOpen.  Thanks to Marco
#                              Dings.
#     5.00  10/06/96 21:42     Fully rewrote script around CGI.pm library.
#                              As soon as I get the time, I'll write more
#                              features into it, but for now, this version
#                              is stable (to the best of my knowledge).
#     5.01  02/09/97 12:41     Fixed some typo's, and added support for
#                              Netscape Communicator.
#     5.02  05/07/97 15:37     Fixed a possible binary file uploading,
#                              added easier support for NT, and fixed
#                              documentation problems. Added the FAQ.
#     5.03  06/19/97 17:30     Fixed a bug which resulted in all files
#                              appearing to be less than one byte in
#                              size, thus uploads weren't saved.
#     6.00  01/23/98 23:06     Added multiple-file uploading.  You can
#                              now upload more than one file at a time.
#                              Also added $MAXIMUM_UPLOAD variable to
#                              restrict file upload sizes.  Script 
#                              completely re-written.  Removed buggy
#                              NT support, and simplified variables.
#                              CGI.pm is no longer bundled with this 
#                              script.  If you need it, download it 
#                              from:
#       http://www.genome.wi.mit.edu/ftp/pub/software/WWW/cgi_docs.html
