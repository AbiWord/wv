.SH DESCRIPTION
.I mswordview
breaks the OLE word document into its component
streams, and then converts the document and its graphics to html. 
.SS OPTIONS
.TP
.I "\-v, \-\-version"
Output program version.
.TP
.I "\-n, \-\-nocredits"
Dont append credits at end of the html output.
.TP
.I "\-c, \-\-corehtmlonly"
Dont put <html> and </html> around output.
.TP
.I "\-f points, \-\-defaultpointsize points"
The base pointsize for mswordview is 10 (like ms word), you can change this
to a different size if you feel that your output is too large, otherwise e.g a 12
point font becomes a html font+2, which can look too big. An aside here... many of the files that
mswordview outputs are tagged as being in unicode, often this turns out to be unnecessary, but theres
no sure way to know sometimes (short of examining every single character in advance to see if it falls into 
the ascii range) if this header is necessary. Thus netscape will use a unicode font, as most european readers
wont ever have read a document in this font they wont have customized the unicode base font size as they might have done
the western font size. So if you have set your usual language encoding fontsize away from the default, then do the
same for your unicode font, sorry about the long entry ;-)
.TP
.I "\-w type, \-\-horizontalwhite type"
attempting to convert formatting done in word with whitespace such as space and tab is quite difficult.
In html output theres no easy way to get nice lined up text using spaces so white space padding
looks awful but of course so does no attempt to do formatting. So i have given five options, the default type is 0 but
i am beginning to think that 2 is the best option really.
.br
.B 0
convert runs of more than one space into hardcoded spaces i.e. &nbsp; 
and convert tabs into a clear gif with width equal to the tabsize option.
.br
.B 1
convert runs of more than one space into hardcoded spaces i.e. &nbsp;
and convert tabs into a run of &nbsp;'s
.br
.B 2
convert runs of more than one space into hardcoded spaces i.e. &nbsp;
but dont convert tabs into anything.
.br
.B 3
dont convert spaces into anything at all but
convert tabs into a clear gif with width equal to the tabwidth option.
.br
.B 4
dont convert spaces into anything at all but
convert tabs into a run of &nbsp;'s
.br
.B 5
dont convert spaces into anything at all and
dont convert tabs into anything at all.
.TP
.I "\-u type, \-\-verticalwhite type"
what to do with multiple line breaks is set here. There are three options for type i.e
.br
.B 0 
the default, a single line break becomes a <br>, but if theres a run of more that one, then the first two are transformed
into a <p>, if theres more then they are outputted as <br>, the intention here is to retain the meaning that
word usually associates with two linebreaks, which is that thats the end of the paragraph, but to be aware
and support the fact that the users of word often whack away madly at the return key to try and force formatting 
decisions by that mechanism. 
.br
.B 1 
replaces each line break one for one with a <br>
.br
.B 2 
replaces a single line break with <br>, and a run of more that one (no matter how long) with a single <p>

.TP
.I "\-t seconds, \-\-timeout seconds"
time out after so many 
.BR seconds , 
useful if you use this as a web gateway, coz theres noone watching the conversion process to 
reaslize that iits gone into a busy loop.
.I "\-s url, \-\-symbolurl url"
this is the url that will be used to find the gif pics that are used for 
displaying the ms symbol font. Not the tidiest of solutions for the
problem, but it works.
.TP
.I "\-d url, \-\-wingdingurl url"
this is the url that will be used to find the gif pics that are used for 
displaying the ms wingding font. Not the tidiest of solutions for the
problem, but it works.
.TP
.I "\-p url, \-\-patternurl url"
this is the url that will be used to find the background patterns that msword
can use as backdrops for cells of a table, this is hardly the most important
of msword features, but theres always someone bleating for some feature that
appears ridiculous to me to be included, so here this one is in all its glory.
This dir is also used for any extra graphics that mswordview might use, e.g. the
clear gif optionally used for tab.
.TP
.I "\-h, \-\-ignoreheadings"
dont convert msword heading types into html heading levels, sometimes users use
heading types inappropiately, if the user used heading types but changed the
attributes to make the heading type inappropiate for html heading levels, use this
option.
.TP
.I "\-a, \-\-noannotations"
By default mswordview will output annotations, but msword itself doesnt print
annotations when outputting to paper, so to not have them included use this
option.
.TP
.I "\-m, \-\-mainonly"
With this option then no footers or headers are shown.
.TP
.I "\-b, \-\-riskbadole"
With this option on then mswordview will attempt to decode files whose ole tables
are corrupt, more than likely the broken word file will crash mswordview, and crash
it hard.
.TP
.I "\-e, \-\-nofontfaces"
With this option set mswordview wont insert fontface tags, as it stands fontfaces
are on by default, but this feature is alpha so it is only supported for ascii
based languages (i.e western european only) and then only under certain conditions
, as it is suprisingly difficult to be sure which of a few choices is the correct font
to use otherwise.
.TP
.I "\-o filename, \-\-outputfile filename"
set the filename to place output in, use - as the filename to output
to standard output (the screen). The default is that output is put into
a file the same name as the input file with a .html ending. Any graphic
files created have the same prefix as this file.
.TP
.I "\-g filename, \-\-errorfile filename"
set the filename to place error messages in. The default is the stderr
(the screen)
.TP
.I "\-y tabvalue , \-\-tabsize tabvalue"
specifies either the amount of pixels of indentation that a tab should be translated
into, or the amount of hard spaces to replace one with, multiples of 8 only work in
the second case. read the horitontalwhite entry to understand which one will get used. Pixels
is the default measurement. This is messy because tabs are obviously messy things
under html, and wed all be better off if they didnt exist at all, but we live in a 
world where they get used for indentation, and worse, alignment, which youll
basically just be damn lucky if you see any hint of that in the html output :-)
Tabs basically just dont work.
.TP
.I "\-i directory, \-\-imagesdir directory"
Specifies the dir into which the graphics will be saved into, the default is the
same dir that the html file is placed in. If you use this but intend to move the graphics
before viewing the html information, or for some other reason you want the html to
link to the graphics with some custom img src url then use --imageurl in conjunction with this
.TP
.I "\-j url, \-\-imagesurl url"
Specifies the url in which the graphics from the word doc can be found, the default is the
same dir that mswordview put the graphics itself.
.TP
.I "\-k, \-\-notablewidth"
With this on, table widths are not specified.
.TP
.I "\-r, \-\-norevisions"
With this on, no revision marks are displayed
.TP
.I "\-x dir, \-\-truetypedir dir"
Specifies the dir in which truetype fonts can be found to be used in the libwmf conversion
of wmf files to gif. The default is the ttf subdir of the install dir of mswordview
.TP
.I "\-z file, \-\-configfile file"
Specifies the configuration file of mswordview. The default is the install dir of mswordview.
See the example config file for details of its format. mswordview can function fully without
a config file.
.SH BUGS
I appear to have gone a little mad on the number of command line options, i have
only 4 letters left l,q,x & z. Some of these options arent really needed, i dont
use 
.B any 
of them myself :-)
.PP
mswordview can be incredibly slow when a document is fastsaved and has many tables.
